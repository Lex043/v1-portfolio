                I'm a frontend-focused software developer who builds
                production-ready web applications that help teams ship fast and
                deliver great user experiences. I specialize in crafting clean,
                responsive interfaces with attention to detail, performance, and
                smooth interactions, turning product requirements into
                intuitive, user-friendly experiences.

                My work often involves building and maintaining real-world
                features in JavaScript and TypeScript, working with modern
                frontend frameworks, and collaborating closely with design and
                backend teams.

                Outside of project work, I actively explore Linux and
                infrastructure to better understand how applications run in
                production so I can write more reliable code, debug issues
                effectively, and make informed technical decisions.
